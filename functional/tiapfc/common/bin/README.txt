fcgistarter notes:

This FCGI server only runs on linux and is available through generic Apache.  Generally you do not need to build Apache every time, but just build it once and keep fcgistarter available for use.  

OHS dev already builds fcgistarter but it is not included in the OHS distribution.  This version was provided by Mike Rumph on 150320.  

This version may need to be replaced in future with Apache upgrades.
